Continuation of the OverbiteFF project for Pale Moon

Cameron  of FloodGap created the OverbiteFF project to allow Firefox to access Gopherholes natively, without use of a proxy.  This was part of his major effort to wake Gopher from hibernation.  However, the complete change in the addon / extension format for Firefox forced development to move to a WebExtensions compatible format - OverbiteWX and OverbiteNX, while development ceased on the original program.

Pale Moon, however, still used the same addon format, and the addon worked well, supporting Gopher bookmarks and navigation.  However, the 29.2 updated to Pale Moon shifted to require that addons specifically target Pale Moon.
